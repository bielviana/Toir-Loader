# Toir Loader
App made for the purpose of loading the script launcher and automatically importing the user-defined configuration file with just one click.

It's simple but very useful, as it doesn't have all the manual and repetitive work needed before starting each game.

## Tutorial
1. First of all open Toir Infinity/Alpha manually and log in with your account, then you can close it and from now on we will only use Toir Loader.

2. The first time you open the application, a configuration window will open automatically, next time just click on the gear icon in the upper right corner if you want to change any settings.

3. In the first field select the Toir executable, in the button below this field just click to enable the use of a custom profile.

4. In the 2nd fields you must select the configuration file you want to use.
```
#   I recommend that before that, create a folder inside the root folder of Toir Loader and save
#   your profiles inside it, for the sake of organization.
```
5. In the 3rd and last field, select the Toir configuration folder, usually located in a path similar to the example below:
```
#   C:\Program Files\AS1\DDD861CA26FE5F5F9F4BD2A165A82B2E\config`
```
6. Now just leave the Toir Loader open and, whenever you start a game, just click on the "LOAD" button and the application will do everything else.
